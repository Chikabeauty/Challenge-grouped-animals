This is a webpage about animal group names, with a few headings and images as examples. There were already 2 CSS rules to style the <h1>s - one with a pseudo selector, and one without. I created an HTML document with the following code provided by eHA academy. I added another selector to each of the rules, so that they also style <h2>s.
